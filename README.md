# yolov8-detection

This is a program that detects objects using the **Y**ou **O**nly **L**ook **O**nce or YOLO neural network. For computational power sake's it is trained on the Coco128 dataset for 100 epochs only. The training took 5 hours which resulted a YOLO model good enough for object detection.

Follow the steps below to use the program.

## How to use:

1. Download file
2. Extract file
3. Open file in VSCode or run CLI. Make sure the working directory is the extracted folder (working/directory/yolov8-detection)
4. Run the following command: python -u "c:\working\directory\yolov8-detecion\object_detector.py"
5. Open browser and enter "localhost:8080
6. Choose random file image to test the YOLO program

The model was trained in a Google Colab which can be found here:
